# discordP
A library written in node.js for interacting with the Discord API.
Coded by someone with okay experience in node.js.
Made because I wasn't a fan of discord.js and discordie, and I was using discordie which is extremely out of date.
I also like being able to know how the backend works, and I prefer using my own code when I can.
If you have suggestions, go ahead and post them!

I used the Discord documentation and Fiddler to write the api stuff.
